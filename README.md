# gatsby-theme-lodge

Gatsby theme for bulding beautiful and customizable landing pages for *Freemasons's Lodges.*

_Built with :heart: for Brazil's Lodge "Acácia da Borborema" nº 41._

It uses [gatsby-transformer-pages-json](https://github.com/luciannojunior/gatsby-transformer-pages-json) for building the site with full customization.

**WIP ALERT:** I'm still building this architecture and it **will** change overtime. The page creation is stil being done in the theme side but we will probably overcome this issue and move it to the plugin.

## Install

`yarn add @luciannojunior/gatsby-theme-lodge`

## How to use

In your `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `@luciannojunior/gatsby-theme-lodge`,
  ],
}
```
